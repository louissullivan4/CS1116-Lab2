rsp.py, write a server-side Python program that:
  gets the user's choice and validates it;
    simulates the computer's choice of Rock, Scissors or Paper by generating a random number, 0, 1 or 2, where 0 means Rock, 
      1 means Scissors and 2 means Paper;
      compares the user's input to the system's choice; and outputs the outcome using a sentence such as 
      "Computer's Rock beats User's Scissors", or "User's Paper beats Computer's Rock"
      
In fruit.html, write a form containing four checkboxes, labelled Apples, Bananas Jujubes and Rambutans. On submit, 
the data is passed to the fruit.py program using the get method. The program validates the user's data, and calculates 
and prints the total cost of the fruits that the user selected. For example, if the user selected the Apples and Jujubes 
checkboxes, then the program displays 29.40 (i.e. 1.59 + 27.81).
